The four assailants at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel were identified as Hafeez Arshad alias Bada Abdul Rehman, Javed alias Abu Ali, Shoaib alias Soheb, and Nazeer alias Abu Umer. Throughout the night they used hand grenades, automatic weapons, and explosives causing a fire in the hotel.  By 0530, the fire was contained but the assailants had taken 100-150 hostages in the hotel's club. Police, army, and fire rescue personnel worked to apprehend the assailants, free the hostages, and control the fire. At 1400 on 11/29/2008, officials regained control of the Taj and all assailants had been killed. Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack.
