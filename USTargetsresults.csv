The vehicle was parked on 45th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.","05/01/2010: On Saturday evening at approximately 1830, in New York City, New York, United States of America, a t-shirt vendor located between 45th Street and Seventh and Eighth Avenues noticed a dark-colored Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) parked at the curb with its engine running and its hazard lights on. Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers. The vehicle, a dark blue 1993 Nissan Pathfinder with tinted windows, had license plates that were registered to a Ford pickup truck that had been taken to a junkyard near Bridgeport, Connecticut some time during the last half of April (license plate: 98C Y09). Additionally, the vehicle identification number (VIN) had been removed from the SUV. No casualties were reported and no group immediately claimed responsibility. However, on 05/02/2010, the Taliban posted a video on YouTube claiming responsibility for the event, saying that it was revenge for the killing of Baitullah Mehsur, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri.
